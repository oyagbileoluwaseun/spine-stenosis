### 🔎 Project Overview
This project integrates medical imaging AI with a voice-enabled clinical assistant to support **early detection and triage** of cervical and lumbar spinal disorders. A computer-vision model analyzes scans and a conversational agent explains results, enabling safe, patient-friendly communication and decision support.

### 🎯 Core Objectives
- 🧠 **Detect & classify** spinal abnormalities using robust AI models  
- 🔍 **Provide explainable insights** (Grad-CAM, SHAP) for clinical transparency  
- 🗣️ **Enable natural, voice-based interactions** for patients and clinicians  
- 🔗 **Combine multimodal learning** (text, image, audio) for holistic triage

**Keywords:** Spinal Stenosis, Medical Imaging, Explainable AI, Conversational AI, Clinical Triage
